# warmup exercise
# questrom.datasets.diamonds
# 1. write SQL to get the diamonds table from Big Query
# 2. keep only numeric columns (pandas can be your friend here!)
# 3. use kmeans to fit a 5 cluster solution
# 4. create a boxplot of the column carat by cluster label (one boxplot for each cluster)
# OPTIONAL:  silhouette plot for the records   <------this will take a few minutes to run, we will discuss




## your exercise
## fit a pca model for the diamonds
## make sure you think about data pre-processing
## plot out the explained variance of the new PCAs based on your dataset
